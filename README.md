# Automated Response Generation
This project contains scripts for generating automated responses or observations using a character represented by the `GenerativeAgent` class. The character interacts with some form of language model or text data, possibly generating responses based on certain inputs.
## File Structure
- `gen_agent.py`: Defines the `GenerativeAgent` class, which represents a character with memory and innate characteristics.
- `main.py`: Main script that imports several modules and the `GenerativeAgent` class.
- `main_auto_observations.py`: Similar to `main.py`, imports the same modules and the `GenerativeAgent` class.
- `requirements.txt`: The requirements file for the project.
- `license.txt`: The license file for the project.
